|Cliché | Game idea |
|----- |----- |
| General game clichés | Demons/Undead enemies, being the golden hero, desert as act 2 |
| A blast from the past | "Store" an attack which shows up at random later |
| A diamond is forever | If the player loot a diamond, it will forever take up a spot in the inventory (Only one available in the game?)|
| It's dangerous to go alone, take this | Recieve a sword at the beginning of the game? |
| A jack of all trades and a master of none | If the player picks skills from more than one tree, the last super-skills will be locked |
| A journey of a thousan miles starts with the first step | When the player first moves they will recieve a quest to walk 1000 in-game miles |
| A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down | A spoon shows up and pour sugar over the player when a health pot is used/Pay a spoonful of sugar to upgrade the health pot   |
| A wolf in sheep's clothing | The player will have a friendly "sheep" helping out, at the end it will attack the player. It will be 100% obvious during the whole time that it is a wolf dressed up as a sheep |
| All that glitters is not gold | Some loot is just pure crap (Maybe the player have to pay to get rid of it?) |
| Double edged sword | A name of a sword, when the player uses it, it also damages the player |
